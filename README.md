A "work in progress" iOS 10.3.x jailbreak

*For 64-bit devices prior to the iPhone 7 (A7 - A9)*

Made from off the shelf parts and shared research, long live the jailbreak community!

‚ÄºÔ∏è **Public codebase is frozen while I prepare the release candidate.** ‚ÄºÔ∏è


## ingredients

+ [v0rtex](https://github.com/siguza/v0rtex) kernel exploit by Siguza, vuln by Ian beer, POC by windknown
+ kernel patch protection bypass from [yalu102](https://github.com/kpwn/yalu102) by Luca Todesco
+ modified patchfinder from [extra_recipe](https://github.com/xerub/extra_recipe) by Xerub
+ extra sandbox work from [h3lix](https://h3lix.tihmstar.net) by tihmstar


## issues

~~GPS stops functioning while jailbroken.~~

~~Location services fails while jailbroken.~~

TouchID not working in apps after jailbreaking.


## notes

Spawns an SSH server listening on port 2222 (for now). Remember to change your passwords (passwd command, default is alpine).

Please reinstall the bootstrap when you try a new build.


## DO NOT INSTALL UNOFFICIAL IPAs*

This is my first jailbreak and I have been making mistakes as I learn. Please wait until I make an official release.


## much love

Siguza, Ian beer, windknown, Luca Todesco, Xerub; tihmstar the legend for reaching out and coming in with the clutch sandbox save and being an awesome guy; Powerful Saurik for Cydia and answering my questions and being a boss; Abraham Masri for reaching out and answering my n00b questions; PsychoTea for his patchfinder mods and kernel helpers, ARX8x, ninjaprawn, DrTC, ... if I've left you out just let me know :)

I am extremely grateful for everyone whose open-source/public contributions to iOS research and tools made it possible for somebody with my unqualified skillset to pull this off. Peace!
